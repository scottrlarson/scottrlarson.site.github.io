<h3 id="mission">Mission</h3>
<p>To solve government corruption by educating people on the real reasons corruption in these institutions exists. To counter the lies the people have been sold in the media and in politics to manipulate the minds of the public to go along with instead of combating corruption.</p>
<h3 id="information-about-author">Information about Author</h3>
<p>I have operated as a private computer service man from 2006 to 2017. In that time I have studied and have learned the following topics: Natural Law, How marketing is used to control the human mind into going along with forms of tyranny, how our educational systems are run by designing people who want to <a href="http://www.deliberatedumbingdown.com/MomsPDFs/DDDoA.sml.pdf">dumb down our children</a>. My writings on the subject can be read at commonwealths.org. My research and writing on the subject of corruption in society is based on the realization that humanity is being held back by designing psychopaths who are misleading the public by using the mainstream media, and other covert tools to distract the people from there own inherent ability to act to right the wrongs in society.</p>
<p>&quot;Education is the only sure preservation of freedom.&quot; -Thomas Jefferson</p>
<p>There is no sure fire way to project the successful operation of this movement. Time is the ultimate factor since we have been living under these conditions for 100 years at least. It will at least take a quarter of that time for a real shift to happen. The reason why I am doing this now is because I see that the people are ready for change . If you resonate with this message I urge you to be careful who you share this information with as there is a dynamic that is happening in society that reacts negatively to this information. Most belief systems today are of the mindset that we don't have to do any real work to fix societies problems, that government will do it for us. We think that that people are so lost that they will do anything to avoid having to face what we are responsible for creating thorough our ignorance or inability to do anything. There are covert groups that are capitalizing on this belief system and helping to propagate the apathy so they may maintain control over politics, finances, and people through the dumbing down of children in our public schools and through the propagation of diversionary politics in the mainstream media.</p>
<h1 id="strategy">Strategy</h1>
<p>I plan on hosting what I call &quot;Truth Fairs&quot; which will be events held at regular intervals once or twice a week depending on resources that become available to combat the war on consciousness using education materials I have created to target and expose false belief systems that have been covertly sold to the public. Education is a big focus now because we cannot move forward with external goals until we know how we are being targeted. I believe that once people are aware that the problem with corruption is that we are unaware of how our minds are being targeted through the media.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>This covert take over of our institutions is very well planed out. We first need to educate the public on the level of control this covert plan has taken in the minds of the public in order for us to effect change on these issues. If we try to effect change without this step our own people will work against us because they have bought into this covert installation. I will not take any political action until at least twenty percent of the population have been education on these issues. It will take at least five or ten years of education to get twenty percent of the population up to speed on these issues by my intuitive estimates, but I could be wrong. That is only if the people are ready for this information, and if I packaged this information well enough to be distributed widely. I leave that judgment up to others who are intelligent enough to see where I am going with this. Please be aware that I did not create this information myself. This information was created by researching topics from many people on-line. The bulk of this information came from Mark Passio and he got his information from others. He is a aggregator of awareness and consciousness information as am I.</p>
