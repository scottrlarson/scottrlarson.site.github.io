<p>I was thinking about this idea of getting audio or video/audio or even text over video recordings of people who are interested in having something to say about a particular topic, say for instance the Austerity measures in Greece. Then I could compile all the video clips into one piece with some music and shots of whats going on in greece as a way to say hey, the world doesn't approve of what is happening in Greece, this is our way of helping shed like on what people really think about what is going on.</p>
<p>I feel like something needs to be done to stop whats happening in Greece, this is going to effect all of us really soon, and I think its a great way to say something about what we all care about.</p>
<p>I was thinking of making a specific channel on vimeo for this called "What the world really thinks" and then we could help spread the message around the world. I think the best thing we can do right now is to put a human face to this and prevent the establishment from controlling the narrative.</p>
<p>Would anybody be interested in recording a short 20 seconds to 1min video of what we think about about this topic, posting it to their youtube channel then linking it to me on twitter using my twitter handle @trinsic1 with the message "permission to use for #whattheworldreallythinks, or uploading it to me per special request and I can grab it that way.</p>
<p>If people dont know what to say, Ill make the first video in a couple of days and link it here and maybe we can go from there.</p>
<p>If anyone has any suggestion on a smaller hash tag or anything else about this idea that would help. my website is <a class="imgScanned" href="http://www.commonwealths.org">www.commonwealths.org</a><span class="keyNavAnnotation" title="press 1 to open link">[1] </span> if you are interested in keeping this alive. You can sign up there and eventually I will put some features in place to make these events for video submission a bit more stream lined.</p>
