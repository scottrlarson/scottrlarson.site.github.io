It confused gary (understandably) that I was using terms in person at th gathing [cilvil law] and in the adegda I wrote [roman law] so I replied that roman law meant civil law.</p> <p><br>At this point he emailed me back and wanted to know why i uploaded the recording and that nobody would need to see it they can look at the agenda if nessary.<br><br>I explained that there are ethical people who are signed up to the commonwealths that track our progress and that they would want to hear about what was said.<br><br>At this point Gary was upset that I didn't include the video project part he ask me to do. apparent there was a mis-commication (maybe on my part) that the gather <br>#2 was primarly focus on what we can do to deal with de facto goverment<br><br>I called Gary over the phone to explain that I thought that was a sepret personal inquiry that shouldn't be induced in the gathering recording since the gathering's primary focus was on edication on civil law and how it effects our society in a negative way and what steps we can take to stay within the common law in local communities.<br><br>Gary seemed to be upset over the phone to me and while we were talking about the disagreement/misunderstanding made a claim that I was trying to control the situaton, and that he didn't want be apart of what we were doing if I was going to control things. He also made a reference to another group we were in in the past to try and prove his point.<br><br>It was at this point I didn't want to listen to any thing further because I feel I was in the right for what I did at the CMM group and that He wanted to end the conversation and leave me with what he said.<br><br>I said that I will not hold a burden that is not mine, Gary said he had to go and that was the end of the call.<br><br>He emailed me later with this response:</p> <blockquote>Scott,<br><br>What I meant about the video shoot in my e-mail was that I wanted the arrangements<br>included in our meeting. I didn't distinguish between during the meeting and after<br>the meeting. Neither did you before today, as I recall, at least not when speaking with<br>me. We did meet yesterday at your house, and during the meeting we discussed not <br>only common law vs. civil or statutory law and the Commonwealths but also community <br>networking and my insurance problem. You regard the situation differently so I need<br>to explain further.<br><br>When I thought further about yesterday's meeting today I understood why I <br>originally wanted to discuss the Commonwealths' operation and timetable during the <br>meeting. It's because I've been getting used to the idea of the Commonwealths these<br>past few weeks. I wanted to know and still want to know how it'll work on a practical<br>level as opposed to the concepts expressed on your website, many of which are very <br>good but some of which are expressed philosophically. I don't think I was completely <br>ready to hear about a discussion of common law vs. statutory law, or at least I would've<br>preferred to hear much more about the Commonwealths. BTW, as I said to you, what <br>I wrote in my article about community networking is at least partly theoretical. I don't <br>know if all of it will work in practice.<br><br>Regardless, I remember that you were enthusiastic about community networking when <br>you first read my article about it.<br><br>In any case, whether we cover these different topics during different meetings for<br>the sake of organization or discuss them during any one meeting, my purpose<br>for working together with you is for our empowerment and the empowerment of<br>others at the community level. I remember making that clear from the <br>beginning. It includes the topics we've so far discussed. You've seen my<br>presentation at the one CMM meeting you attended, and you read my<br>Community Networking article. We can achieve our goals through solidarity, <br>and that will require the active participation of our fellow citizens. I know and <br>continue to meet people who are very unhappy with the status quo, and what <br>you and I are working on together can give those people a way of turning their <br>frustrations into productive action. We can provide much-needed leadership in<br>this area. Our different approaches for solving these problems can be a source <br>of strength if we look at it that way, because they'll allow us to reach more people <br>with very different viewpoints. We need to look at this is a larger context. If we <br>don't, we'll only end up at odds with each other and not agree upon anything. <br>We're much alike that way; we like to insist on our being right, and in so doing we <br>can work together counter-productively rather than productively if we don't take <br>steps to reconcile whenever possible. <br><br>I'll be pleased to speak with you by phone about this but it can't be until the <br>weekend because I have a work project for a new client I need to complete by<br>Monday the 15th. In the meantime, please read what I said above carefully and <br>consider whether it addresses your concerns.<br><br>In solidarity,<br><br>Gary</blockquote> <p>I agree that the agenda needs to be agreed on in the future.&nbsp; We should both be more clear on our expectations and intentions.<br><br>I still don't understad the point where all of this broke down but before we move forward i feel things things need to be addressed: <br><br>&nbsp;1. I consider community-solidarity building very important, but not the only topic, but a separate topic along with building better governance. These topics should be moved forward on but not at the same time, there should be different venues for each so the focus does not get shifted from one topic to the other, just like in a real meeting about addressing issues in on topic should not overlap another topic not directly related.<br><br>2. If you have issues with the way I do things, or you have issue with some way I dealt with sometime in the past, it is not appropriate to use as a tool to advance your concerns like you&nbsp; did today over the phone.<br><br>3. if you had issue of something i did in the past the fact that you didn't bring it up before makes me feel like I can't trust you to voice your concerns the moment you become aware of it. In my humble experience people who are passive-aggressive hold on to things that they know they should communicate in the present moment, but hold onto those things to use as as ammunition to later get what they want by bringing up issues that happened in the past.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><br>4. I don't feel like I am make all the decisions on things with out your approval, I have asked for your input on many occasions. I was under the understanding that you were aware of what we were talking about today, It is my understanding is we are not building community-solidarity yet. But that would be a topic of discussion on how we would move forward on that, not make examples happen while we are try to get good governance in place.<br><br>5. It feels like you want to advance an agenda that is not known to me, because I thought we are on the same page that community-solidarity is one of many topics, but are the same topics.<br><br>6. I feel like you are holding back on your intent, you like you want to make this a solely a networking thing when I have been clear from the start that that is and import topic, but not something that we can really explore until we get our governance back under our control.<br><br>7. Ill understand fully if you want to focus exclusively community-solidarity, but as i said before educating people on our system of government and how it needs to be changed/handled needs to of primary importance. I noticed some resistance from you before on this. Please get clear on where you want to primarily focus so we can move forward together. If that is not something you can do please let me know, no hard feelings at all on my part. Certain things need to be done in certain ways for this to happen and you may not be aware of why and that may be of primary frustration for you.</p></div></div></div>  </div>        <div class="link-wrapper">       <ul class="links inline"><li class="comment_forbidden first"><span><a href="../../member/login?destination=node/136%23comment-form">Log in</a> or <a href="../../member/register?destination=node/136%23comment-form">register</a> to post comments</span></li> <li class="print_html last"><a href="../../print/136" title="Display a printer-friendly version of this page." class="print-page" rel="nofollow">Printer-friendly version</a></li> </ul>    </div>      <div id="comments" class="comment-wrapper">      <a id="comment-4"></a> <div class="comment comment-by-node-author clearfix" about="/comment/4#comment-4" typeof="sioc:Post sioct:Comment">    <div class="attribution">           <div class="submitted">       <p class="commenter-name">         <span rel="sioc:has_creator"><span class="username" xml:lang="" about="/users/scott-larson" typeof="sioc:UserAccount" property="foaf:name" datatype="">Scott Larson</span></span>      </p>       <p class="comment-time">         <span property="dc:date dc:created" content="2017-05-11T17:40:17-07:00" datatype="xsd:dateTime">Thu, 05/11/2017 - 5:40pm</span>      </p>       <p class="comment-permalink">         <a href="../../comment/4#comment-4" class="permalink" rel="bookmark">Permalink</a>      </p>     </div>   </div>    <div class="comment-text">     <div class="comment-arrow"></div>               <h3 property="dc:title" datatype=""><a href="../../comment/4#comment-4" class="permalink" rel="bookmark">I dissagree on this point #1</a></h3>          <div class="content">       <span rel="sioc:reply_of" resource="/node/136/index.html" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span><div class="field field-name-comment-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><blockquote><p>"We can achieve our goals through solidarity,&nbsp;and that will require the active participation of our fellow citizens."</p> </blockquote> <p>We need to first need to fully understand what we are up against. Everyone that is leading this charge needs to understand fully what we are up agaist before we can take action. That was my goal and still is, we need to know and understand the level of covert infiltrition of our governement. We can not achive our goals though solidarty if we don't understand what we are up against. Most peoples beleif systems have been co-oped, any many don't understand the best place to start. Thats why you see everyone still using our current political system to efect change with little or no sucess. Most people dont understand its been co-opted by people that don't have our direct intersts at heart.</p> </div></div></div>          </div> <!-- /.content -->      <ul class="links inline"><li class="comment_forbidden first last"><span><a href="../../member/login?destination=node/136%23comment-form">Log in</a> or <a href="../../member/register?destination=node/136%23comment-form">register</a> to post comments</span></li> </ul>  </div> <!-- /.comment-text --> </div>    </div>  </div>   </div> </div>   </div>                                               </div>                    </div><!-- /#content -->                                      <div class="clear"></div>                              	</div>            	        </div> <!-- /#wrap -->  </body> </html>
