# My thoughts on the living situation in the states and activism activities that I am working on to change it.

I wont be working from 432 Humboldt St any longer, actually I don't know where I am going to be yet but I wanted to let my customers know what I happening so they don't thing I disappeared. I am just going to come right out and say what is on my mind about this. Apologies to anyone that becomes offended by this or thinks it is unprofessional for me to be saying what I am saying here, I feel I want to let people know why I am making this decision. For those that want to know. If you don't want to know please stop reading this now.

The rent is too high and I don't want to operate in a society that allows government to use a currency that they can inflate at any time to cause prices to reach a point where is not beneficial to make a living any longer. I'm not sure how this effects real estate myself as I am not an expert in that field, but I think I has something to do with this: when prices get high there are people that can afford to buy things and people who can't. The people who can't afford to stay where ever it is they are staying are pushed out to make room for people who can. The problem can be explained in a myriad of different ways, depending on what information you have taken in over your life. I never wanted; nor do I want to work over 30hrs a week myself to make a living. I have other projects I am working on as I will describe, but the main point is I don't think anyone should be forced to work to a point where they don't have time to focus on improving themselves.

I'm not sure yet what I am going to do. I know that I need to find a place for my wife so if anyone knows of anyone that is renting a room or a granny unit for under $400.00 please let me know.

My problem is that I am having a crisis of conscience

I have been getting into activism lately as a way to channel my energy into something worth while that can change society if people want it. But it's big leap for many to do, I know. [I have been very angry and frustrated that we have allowed this country to fall so low.](http://www.commonwealths.org/article/war-conscience) Maybe you have not seen any problems, if that is so then this link is not for you.
