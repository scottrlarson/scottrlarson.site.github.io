#Initial Consultation-Diagnostic (Free)

I can fix some problems over the internet. This requires an internet connection, scheduling an appointment with me 24hrs in advance, software I will help you download to your computer to fix the problem, and your autorization to allow me to access your computer over the internet to diagnose the issue or make the repairs. 

- A free 20-minute initial consultation / diagnostic. 
- An estimate of work involved required parts and costs.
