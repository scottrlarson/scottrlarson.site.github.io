	<h1>Claims Have Power - Petitions Give Power</h1>
	<p>I got an email today from openmedia.org today, It reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;Scott--we’re walking into a ‘link tax’ ambush! We have only 24 hours to get the message out–will you help us to make lots of noise and raise the alarm now?</em><br><br><em>-----</em><br><br><em>This is unbelievable. On the heels of a major victory, powerful anti-Internet forces have redoubled their efforts and won’t rest until they’ve imposed their backwards vision for the future of the Web on all of us.</em><br><br><em>We stopped their link censorship scheme last vote1 because people like you spoke out in huge numbers. But anti-Internet ranks are growing. First we had MEP Cavada,2 now a dangerous new coalition of anti-Internet forces pushing for this ‘link tax’ that could ruin the Internet we love.</em><br><br><em>We can't stand for it. If we let this amendment pass, many of your favorite websites could be saddled with paying this discriminatory and unfair tax–just for linking.</em><br><br><em>Join our campaign and sound the alarm now. <a href="http://qb.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=1iQurBEScD8GnVgnpsCY%2FOrLMvytzhj0">If enough of us speak out in the next 24 hours they will drop their outrageous ‘link tax’ ambush.</a></em></p>
<p><br>Unfortunately, the link takes you to a page where you fill out information to send your petition to your representative so you can have your "voice" heard.</p>
<p>Remember the Matrix, when Neo is with the agents of the matrix and he says, "I know my rights, I want my phone call". Agent smith says, "What good is a phone call if you are unable to speak?"</p>

<h3>The Universe answers to people who have power, not to people that give power.</h3>
<p>Our world is ruled by people who have power not by people who give power. To clarify, I don't mean we should have power over others. Echart Tolle once said "Power over others is weakness disguised as strength, true power is within." Instead, its a sad fact that the universe answers to those who have power regardless of how they got it, even if its not real power and it harms the power holder in the long run. If you want to have power to make real change for the benefit of everyone you will need to stop giving away your power to others through applications and petitions. Petitions and applications do exactly that give power to others to make decisions for you. You wont be heard by the universe and this system unless you start claiming your power. One of the ways to claim power is to make statements of fact, that's backed up by your natural authority to exist. Instead I suggest we start making claims of right. A claim of right simply means, I am the authority and you being an agent of the government work for the people, here is what I require. Prove me wrong.</p>
<h3>Your first Claim Of Right Letter</h3>
<p>I would instead handle this by writing a letter to the particular law makers or people who plan on enforcing an unjust law. Please be aware this is not legal advise. This is what I would lawfully do based on what I have learned. Every person or business who wants to end this charade should consider learning about how to make claims of right. This is how I would do it:&nbsp; "Dir sir, I use the Internet as my method of communication to operate my life or business. It is my understanding that I own or rent the business where the telecommunication lines enter into my establishment. This gives me exclusive right of use. Your attempt to place a tax on links puts an undue financial burden on my establishment. Please provide any evidence or any facts that you have to back up your claim to place a condition of use on my method of communication. You have 15 days to respond, and after that you lose any ability to make further claims on my property. Attached is my fee schedule containing my fees for attempting to collect taxes on my right of use."</p>
<h3>Writing a letter and mailing it as a Sovereign Individual</h3>
<p>In order for this to work, you first need to make sure both your claim of right and fee schedule are both notarized and the letter needs to be sent via certified mail with return signature.&nbsp; Second, you need to make sure that you establish where this letter will be coming from. This will not work If your return address is located in the United States district of columbia. You have to send this letter from a place of power, the land outside of the U.S. jurisdiction. The United States is a forign corporation that operates outside of common law jurisdiction. It extracts wealth from all of the states through the zip code which is tied to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.">district of columbia</a>. Alteratively, every state was built on a Republic so you could address this letter from the republic by using the following method. The envelope should contain your Street Address with everything spelled out. For example, my address is like this when I send letters:</p>
<p>C/O Non-Domestic<br>233 Lane Street<br>San Fransisco, California</p>
<p>No zip code seems to work for me. Don't use a zip code, or if you use one it has to be the exempt version. I have heard that some people use: ZipeCode Exempt + DMM 122.32. In order to use ZipCode Exempt I do believe you need to claim post master by writing over the stamp: "With this autograph by: Scott : Larson". I have never tried this so im not sure it works as of yet. We own everything by our natural right to exisit anyway, we have just allowed other entities to take away that right in exchange for benefits and privileges.</p>
<p>In your letter, at the top left should be the the addressee's name, title and address in the U.S district of columbia. At the bottom right on both sides of the page, some form of seal like thumb print or your own creation with a specific signature. Red ink is best. You want to separate the living being from the fictional name that was created for you at birth to show you are not in fact a fiction of the U.S district of columbia, but in fact at living man or women. So you would put at the bottom of your seal: "by: Firstname : Lastname" Below that "Without Prejudice" or "Reserved".</p>
<p>The signature method does a few things. Using the word "by" separates you from the person. the colon is a transition from your signature instrument to your title "I go by: this title" Not " I am firstname lastname". I am creates joinder, you don't want that. the last colon separates who you go by and your family name, which is also not you, but the name of your family. "Without Prejudice" or "Reserved" basically says I retain all my rights under natural law.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Holding Agents Accountable though the Oath of Office and Bond</h3>
<p>When dealing with agents of the government you want to be very clear who you are, All people who claim Sovereignty do this, it separates those who have power, and those who give power.</p>
<p>When an agent of the government takes a position into office, most positions require a oath. To uphold the Constitution and protect the rights of the people. If that person violates that oath, that person can be removed though his bond by applying the correct pressure. This would only be done in the event an agent was trying to use his position of authority to make your liable for his violation of your rights.</p>
