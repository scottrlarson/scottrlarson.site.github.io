But today I took the step to #divest from our entire system of government.</p> <p>Why divest from the government when you can just divest from business dealings with Israel, or with smaller forms of corruption you ask?</p> <ul> <li>We have been fighting against corruptible influences for over 50 years and we are no closer to removing money and corporate influence from politics then we were when we started.</li> <li>We are allowing wars and arbitrary drone attacks against innocent human beings to continue in our name without our consent, The American People are allowing this.</li> <li>Our current two party system is no closer to changing then when it was introduced. People still allow themselves to believe that the electoral process is fair and balanced.</li> <li>Human rights are violated in Ferguson and in other parts of the country with a military presence that is reserved for war.</li> <li>Millions of people's ideas and concerns are marginalized each day by a system bent on maintaining control over the whole world.</li> </ul> <p>When are you going to wake up and realize its not working? An even bigger question is what are you going to do about it? Are you going to let it continue? After your family is taken and put into a concentration camps will that be enough for you? That's what happened to communities in Europe during World War II. Some community leaders laughed out loud when concerned citizens in Poland mentioned that the Third Reich we're putting people in concentration camps. Do you actually think that it can't happen again? Even as we speak the very people that have been destroyed by Nazi Germany are now using the language of Antisemitism to destroy peoples right to speak out against atrocities in Gaza.</p> <p>At some point you got to say enough is enough. That's where I'm at today. I will not and cannot tolerate another moment of systematic dismantlement of human rights in the name of war. People are being led along by the media into a direction a few want us to go, We only need to question it and divest from it too watch it crumble. Politics and Government need our support to continue, when you wake up to that fact you realize you have the power to derail this train before it destroys the entire world.</p> <p>That's why today, I thought this would be a good day to finally get the right documentation filled out and notarized to divest myself from the U.S Government.</p> <p>The documents you see in my hands are the Expatriate-Repatriate Document and the Notice of Intent, Claim of Right. The first document is ready to be sent out to all agents offices of the government and the Claim of Right document I keep on me in case I ever encounter an agent of the government or a peace officer.</p> <p><strong>Why am I doing this?</strong></p> <p>A few reasons:</p> <ul> <li>I don't support the U.S government in its current form, in fact after the research I have done over the years. I have come to the realization that Central Governments are not needed for a stable society. They grew out of a desire for the powerful to exercise control over people to serve special interests alone. For more information on this please see my proposal on a new society called the&nbsp;<a title="The Commonwealths Proposal" href="http://www.commonwealths.org">Commonwealths</a>&nbsp;Or check out the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ubuntuplanet.org/">Ubuntu Party</a>.</li> <li>I needed to be sure I had the right information about Expatriating from the United States, and Repatriating into the American Union. (United States of America). There is a difference between the two. The reason to Expatriate and Repatriate has to do with our current form of government:</li> </ul> <p>In 1861 several southern states walked out of congress refusing to be pushed around by the international bankers and decided to leave the union and break the contract between the states. And they had every right to do that since all the states were sovereign. The quorum to conduct business under the Constitution was lost. Since they did not decide to reconvene, Congress abandon the house and the senate. At that point under the parliamentary law the lawful Congress ceased to exist. A month later a man claiming to be president, Abraham Lincoln issued executive order 1. The reason why Abraham was not president at this point is that his position ceased to exist when the Constitutional contract was abandoned. With Executive order #1, Abraham Lincoln established martial rule over the states and took back control over them claiming the states as federal territories on April 15th. (What happens on April 15th each year?)</p> <p>In 1862 - The fictional person was created. the state created the title person. That which they created, they control.<br />In 1863 - Needing some way to govern the states without the constitutional contract, Lincoln Issues&nbsp;<a href="http://original.antiwar.com/todd_pierce/2014/04/06/the-dark-side-of-liebers-code-or-cheneyite-jurisprudence/">Lieber Code General orders 100</a>. If you have a look at this order, you will see that it applies military rule to times of war. Whats happening today is that this order is being used in the absence of war. This is the government we are living under. The supreme court was abolished and established a new supreme court in the District of Colombia, an area of Washington that is not subject to the&nbsp;<strong>THE</strong>&nbsp;Constitution and though certain methods extends its laws to all of the states under that jurisdiction.</p> <p>They did this by creating a&nbsp;corporate charter called&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>&nbsp;Constitution similar to&nbsp;<strong>THE</strong>&nbsp;Constitution to keep up appearances. This document was used to legislate this authority since the had no authority to subject the states to military law. in the original document. What this does is turn the true intentions of the original Constitution, a static document into a corporate charter; a living document and that gives the U.S Government the power to ignore the real Constitution at will.</p> <p>All persons (Fictional Characters) born or naturalized in the U.S (not the U.S.A) subject to the jurisdiction&nbsp;<strong>to or their of</strong>; of the United States.</p> <p>This is why if you want to be free from corporate control under the U.S Government that you need to Expatriate from the U.S and Repatriate as a American Citizen. This is all done by public notice to respective agents. from my understanding once you put them on notice and it becomes a matter of public record you can then start to assert your rights given to you under&nbsp;<strong>THE</strong>&nbsp;constitution since you put yourself outside the jurisdiction of the United States.</p> <p>At least that's the plan, the reality is that I will probably encounter problems with people recognizing my new status. I plan on dealing with these challenges as they arise with my notice of intent. There is much more to this process then what I have done so far, but its a start. I plan on adding further blogs that have outlined what I have learned as I continue the process.</p> <p>From my understanding, please be aware that if you plan on going this route, be forewarned that you will no longer be able to claim the privileges of having any Government or State Issued Identification, Insurance, Benefits, Privileges and or Income Tax Liability (Unless you work for the government or are an agent of the government). The plan is to operate without these things, work independently of the U.S as a private man or women and there are many safe and legal ways to do this. You are basically completely responsible for your actions which is the way it should be. In the current structure of government you are still liable anyway but liable to the rules and regulations of U.S government special interests instead of laws created to serve human interests.</p> <p>If you want more information about this process you can check out the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.goldenpath.net/alliance-truth/civil-disobedience/civil-rights-enforcement/notice-expatriation-repatriation">documents</a>&nbsp;yourself and see if its for you, even if this is not something you can't do, what you can do to stop supporting government makes a big differnce in this battle to stop corruption.</p> </div></div></div>  </div>        <div class="link-wrapper">       <ul class="links inline"><li class="blog_usernames_blog first"><a href="../../blogs/scott-larson" title="Read Scott Larson&#039;s latest blog entries.">Scott Larson&#039;s blog</a></li> <li class="comment_forbidden"><span><a href="../../member/login?destination=node/54%23comment-form">Log in</a> or <a href="../../member/register?destination=node/54%23comment-form">register</a> to post comments</span></li> <li class="print_html last"><a href="../../print/54" title="Display a printer-friendly version of this page." class="print-page" rel="nofollow">Printer-friendly version</a></li> </ul>    </div>       </div>   </div> </div>   </div>                                               </div>                    </div><!-- /#content -->                                      <div class="clear"></div>                              	</div>            	        </div> <!-- /#wrap -->  </body> </html>
