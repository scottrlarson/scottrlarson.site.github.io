All rules, codes, and statutes are contracts. That means you have to agree to these policies in order to be bound by them. There are a lot of ways you can be tricked into being bound by them. One of the ways is giving them your license or identity card which creates joinder between i: the man (you) and the statutory person (the fiction government created for you without your knowledge or consent. If you can help it, never bring a drivers license or identity card with you. If you don't feel comfortable with that, or need to have these documents on you, explain to the man (woman) (peace officer or public servant) that “for the purposes of exercising my rights, I do not require a drivers license or identity card.” Under no circumstances should you get dragged into a debate at any time during this encounter. If by the third time repeating this statement the man acting as a peace officer or public servant does not yield, then ask “Are you going to continue to interfere with my rights by forcing me to produce identification without a claim I have done wrong?” If they still ignore you and request that information, then you need hand them what ever they request and say, “For the record, I am offering this information to under duress and that the act of handing you this information is not construed as a contract between i: the man (woman) and any state or federal government.”</p> <p>Another way is for them to get you into joinder between the name and i: the man (woman) is for them to ask you your name. When you answer, you are agreeing that you and the name/tile you go by is creating joinder between the two. If they ask you this, calmly ask "Which name are you referring to, the statutory person, or the name given to i: the man (woman) at birth? This separates the natural being and the name, forcing them to find other ways to gain joinder, interfere with your rights anyway, or leave you alone. When a public servant of any kind approaches you for any reason, greet them in peace and immediately ask them if they are present in the capacity of a peace officer or a policy enforcer. If they say both, or a policy enforcer, kindly let them know that you can only recognize the peace officer since you are a man (woman). That probably wont matter to much to them, but it sets up the interaction in the beginning to let them know that you are under a different jurisdiction. If the ask you to comply to a statute, code or rule and complying in your mind constitutes an interference with one of your rights. Kindly ask them "Is that an order?". If they don't answer, or say anything other than “yes”, repeat it three times for each response they give you. On the third "Is that an order?" if they still ignore your question or offer some other answer than “yes” simply state that since you: the man (try to address them by their first name or Mr/Mrs. last name have not answer the question i’m going to take this as an order and comply to all your orders. Also ask them are there any other orders that you need i: the man to comply with. When the whole process is done hand them your own custom fee schedule, you can use mine as a template. You don't need a seal, but it probably helps to have one so they know they are dealing with a man (woman) that has a claim upon the earth.</p> <p>If the public servant back tracks from all the orders he gave you after handing them your fee schedule immediately cancel your fee schedule against the man (woman) acting as peace officer or public servant verbally, or on paper which ever either of you prefer. Do not try and hold someone to a fee if there is no longer a contract or a cancled contract. Otherwise you become the one in dishonor and the court will notice that. If the man (woman) acting as a peace officer or public servant does not backtrack let them know you will be mailing one to their superior officer requiring payment for your services. Politely thank them for their time and then do exactly that. Get the superior officers name, use registered mail to mail the fee schedule to the superior requesting payment with a due date. Do this as soon as possible.</p> <p>If you receive no response or any other response other than a payment unless its a response to get some kind of clarification in the due date time, bring a small claim against the superior officer by his name only, not his office. Do not use his status or official title in anyway when creating the claim or in court. Its best to try and create your own claim form that simulates the courts paper work since this will be your case, not the courts case and file that into the court. Enter a copy of the fee schedule along with a affidavit into the record. Do this before you go to court. In the affidavit describe what happen in the most simple terms possible including what you did to settle the matter and what response you got. One or two sentences should do it.&nbsp; request a certified copy back out that both documents were entered into the record.</p> <p>If you end up in court simply point to the affidavit and fee schedule. Say nothing unless its to clarify what was written in your court documents. Courts try to get you to create joinder between yourself and the statutory name to gain jurisdiction over you so they have power to move the case. If you allow this you will not be able to move your case any further because you will have allowed them to take over you case. Most questions you can simply respond with “How does that effect the matter at hand, my affidavit/fee schedule has all the information you need.” You might have to repeat this 3 or more times before they hear it. There might be other unknows that come up I cannot address here. If that happens address the court with the following words, “I require leave of court to obtain counsel on this matter” Ask for another court date that will give you enough time to have your questions answered (don't communicate this to the court). Then email me and I will see if I can help you or you can go youtube and look for videos from Karl Letnz and spend some time looking at his information. Its a lot to take in but you should get to know who you are and what your rights are in the common law before going to court because they might test you and you will need to know how to respond in some situations.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> </div></div></div>  </div>        <div class="link-wrapper">       <ul class="links inline"><li class="book_printer first last"><a href="../../print/book/export/html/86" title="Display a printer-friendly version of this page." class="print-page" rel="nofollow">Printer-friendly version</a></li> </ul>    </div>       </div>   </div> </div>   </div>                                               </div>                    </div><!-- /#content -->                                      <div class="clear"></div>                              	</div>            	        </div> <!-- /#wrap -->  </body> </html>
