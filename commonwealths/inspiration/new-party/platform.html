The Party has no platform or planks in the traditional sense. It has no opinion on any issue or even any preferred way of thinking about issues. The only requirements to be a candidate for the New Party is that you are Honest, Competent, Reasonable and have enough support to win an election. It is both possible and desirable for two New Party candidates to differ enormously on particular issues. All that is necessary is that they be quality representatives of their constituents and that they be able to engage with each-other in respectful and constructive conversation. In this sense, the New Party is not a 3rd party as much as an Nth Party. If we do our job right, all future political activity will take place “within” the New Party and the actual general election will be a legacy formality.</p> <p>The Party has no platform because it <strong>is</strong> a platform: an open set of technologies that should enable the relatively spontaneous formation of a new way of doing politics. Specifically, it is a combination of a social network, a messaging system and a “jobs board”. At bottom, every member of the network has an identity (at a minimum their name and ZIP Code) and can link to other members of the network --- traditional social networking functions. In addition, they can engage in two basic kinds of kinds of behavior: conversation and activity.</p> <p>Our conversation engine will be substantially similar to existing scale conversation communities like Reddit with a handful of key exceptions. First, participants will not be anonymous. They will have a real (and unique) identity. Second, rather than have a simple architecture of just “up” or “down” voting on given comments, we will have a three dimensional model where a given comment can be evaluated as to its good faith, its thoughtfulness, and, finally, whether it is supported or not. So for example, you might find a given comment that you are sure was issued in good faith and is truly thoughtful, but that you don’t support. Or you might find a comment that you happen to agree with,but that you think was made in bad faith by the original poster (i.e., they are just saying what you want to hear). These two differences bring a number of values. Bad behaviour and thoughtlessness can quickly be identified and downregulated while conversation can be promoted by allowing for respectful disagreement. Finally, of course, the actual topics of our conversation will intially be focused strictly on issues of direct importance to the network itself – although as the community grows, the platform can (and likely will) grow to cover a larger selection of topics.</p> <p>Our “job board” consists of a list of different tasks that an individual can select.Formally, the high level objectives of the New Party are simple:</p> <ul> <li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Get people to join the party.</span></li> <li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Get on the ballot in every election.</span></li> <li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Source qualified candidates.</span></li> <li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Get enough votes to win a given election.</span></li> </ul> <p>The magic happens in how we go about hitting these targets. The high level objectives are tied into the architecture itself. The details are left to the network itself to generate. This is done through a combination of game mechanics and reputation.</p> <p>We want to make it very easy for people to find ways to participate. Our core objective isto get money out of the political process. We do this by replacing the concept of donations of money with the concept of donations of direct activity. When someone joins the network, they are presented with the opportunity to do something. At a minimum, everyone can do three things: they can “vouch” for another member of the Party, they can “support” another member of the Party, and they can “recruit” new people into the Party. The former is simply an expression that you stake your personal reputation on the fact that the other person is honorable, competent and reasonable. By doing this, you become accountable to the rest of the network and can expect people to question you as to why you vouchsafe your connection as the election progresses. Notably, if that individual then goes on to generate for themselves a <strong>negative</strong> reputation, you will likely have to explain your judgement. In principle, you could vouch for every member of the New Party. By contrast, you can “support” only one candidate for anygiven office. This is particularly meaningful: in hotly contested races, those members of the party who vouch for <strong>both</strong> candidates but support only one become important in helping the larger community make the best decisions. Finally, and crucially, every member can become an evangelist of the New Party by recruiting new people into the network. In a highly connected world, this can be a trivial effort: simply posting a link to your Facebook account can be sufficient. Or you can hit the streets and go door-to-door drumming up support for this bold new idea.</p> <p>As you recruit, vouch for and support people, you begin to earn reputation. At aminimum, reputation is status – a nice reward for adding value to the New Party. But,more fundamentally, reputation is the metric by which you are afforded the ability to do more within the Party. In addition to the basic activities of vouch, support and recruit, every member of the Party can go to the “tasking engine” and really get engaged. The tasking system is the beating heart of the New Party. A task is an activity that is linkedup to a high level objective. For example, if the high level objective is “get on the ballotin Florida” the task might be “collect ten signatures”. In keeping with the distributed nature of the New Party, tasks are <strong>not</strong> from top-down by a party hierarchy. Rather, they are generated entirely by the network itself: they are posted by individuals with adequate reputation. For example, a new Party member has established a strong reputation as anevangelist by recruiting many new people into the Party. Her reputation qualifies her to start generating new tasks to “get out the vote” in her local region. As she continues to succeed, she gets more reputation – qualifing her for more authority and responsibility.A positive feedback loop that scales. With only a minimal architecture and some basic game mechanics, we are able to unleash the creativity and passion of the entire community to achieve our core objectives.</p></div></div></div>  <div id="book-navigation-100" class="book-navigation">              <div class="page-links clearfix">               <a href="../../node/19/index.html" class="page-previous" title="Go to previous page">‹ The Architecture</a>                     <a href="../../node/18/index.html" class="page-up" title="Go to parent page">up</a>                     <a href="../../node/21/index.html" class="page-next" title="Go to next page">Running for Office ›</a>           </div>        </div>   </div>        <div class="link-wrapper">       <ul class="links inline"><li class="book_printer first last"><a href="../../print/book/export/html/20" title="Display a printer-friendly version of this page." class="print-page" rel="nofollow">Printer-friendly version</a></li> </ul>    </div>       </div>   </div> </div>   </div>                                               </div>                    </div><!-- /#content -->                                      <div class="clear"></div>                              	</div>            	        </div> <!-- /#wrap -->  </body> </html>
