<p>Here is a profile page mock up for People of the Commonwealths.</p>
<p>Descriptoins of each area From Top to Bottom, Right to Left:</p>
<h3>Top Links</h3>
<ul>

<h3><strong>Profile Page:</strong> Current Landing Page</h3>
</li>
<li><strong>PAST Page:</strong> Further breakdown of past by projects, comments, proposal.</li>
<li><strong>Recommendations:&nbsp;</strong>People that have recommended this person into the particular Commonwealth trait. (I use trait instead of position to break away from hierarchies)</li>
<li><strong>Disuptes:</strong> A page of listed disuptes of the persons conduct durring any actions within the commonwealths, Issued by people involved in said projects, proposals, and comments.</li>
<li><strong>Agreements:</strong> Any agreements the person made when signing up to the commonwealths so that people in the commonwealths can see what that person agreed to and if he is following his mandate or oath.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Photo Section</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trait Bages:</strong> A list of badges attached to the traits the person operates with. A energy panel designer would have a corosponding bage.</li>
<li><strong>Profile Photo:</strong> A photo of the Person.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Past Preview</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>A List of Projects, Proposals Comments, ect</strong>: Rated by the community simmilar to how posts are rated by reddit, accept each raiting would include a score for the person's P.A.S.T information on the right. Proposals could have a benifit score that would be rated by atrributes that reflect how successful it is devleop and orworking in the community.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Profile Info</h3>
<ul>
<li>A Person's Profile Information listing his PAST Karma, PAST Karma is rated by the community upvoting or down voting the P.A.S.T attributes based on that person's actions in the community. A person can have negative PAST and it would relfect here disabling his Commonwealth Traits. His universal status would bec changed as well.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Universal Bond (Symbol to convey the realtionship between the Person, and the Commonwealths as he acts though His Universal Status.</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Commonwealths Benificary Seal:</strong> a symbol is placed here that represents who or what is benifiting from the actions of the Entrusted Person.</li>
<li><strong>The Universal Status:</strong> with what power that person is acting from, simmilar to a universal law in nature. Since everyone has there own beliefs I found that maybe the universe is a best way to unite people to common causes if we relate to the fact that as we go about our lives in the world we still have to answer to something beyond ourselves.</li>
<li><strong>The Entrusted Seal:</strong> Everyone is asked to design their own seal that represents the living part of that person, so that people can see that this person is a real person and not just a fake entity.</li>
</ul>
