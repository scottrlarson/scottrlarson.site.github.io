#Online Assistance

I can fix some problems over the internet. This requires an internet connection, scheduling an appointment with me 24hrs in advance, software I will help you download to your computer to fix the problem, and your autorization to allow me to access your computer over the internet to diagnose the issue or make the repairs. 

- First 15mins is FREE!
- After your FREE 15 minutes, a $30.00 fee will be charged for each half-hour with up to a maximum of three hours.
