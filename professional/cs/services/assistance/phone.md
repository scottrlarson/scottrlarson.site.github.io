#Assistance by Phone

If you need a quick response contact me by phone. I can assist you with a simple problem, or give you advice on a topic of inquiry. If you need a more in-depth response, I suggest you contact me for an in-shop visit, or an at-location consultation. Check out my list of services and my resources section for more information.

- For first time callers, the first 15mins is FREE!
- After your FREE 15 minutes, a $20.00 fee will be charged for each half-hour with up to a maximum of one hour.  Problems that can't be solved after 1 hour of phone time are better served on a face to face basis.
