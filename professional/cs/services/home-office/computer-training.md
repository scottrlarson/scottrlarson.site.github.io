#Computer Training

If you've just purchased a new program or if you don't know how to use some aspect of your computer, I can save you the hassle and frustration of figuring it out on your own with expert guidance on a wide range of products. In a one on one personal consultation, I sit down with you at your computer and explain how to do something using language you can understand.
