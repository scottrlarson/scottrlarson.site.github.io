#Diagnostic

Your computer, laptop, netbook, notebook, PDA, iPad, iPod, or tablet is experiencing trouble and you would like me to give you a professional report on the extent of the problem and or fix the problem along with one of my repair services.

- For Repairs, a full diagnostic is usually performed on a device that is experiencing problems to rule out faulty hardware and can take 24 to 48 non-billable hours to complete.
- In some cases, comprehensive diagnostics on obscure problems can take longer, up to one or sometimes two non-billable weeks. Contact me about getting a loaner device in these situations.
- Half-Off off all diagnostic work when repairs are authorized.
