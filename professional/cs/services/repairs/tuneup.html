<p>If your system is running slow or you are having reoccuring problems with system stablility have it checked out. I use the latest tools and technology to get your system's performance up to a standard you can live with. I will check startup programs, services, drivers, the amount of free memory, provide resource tuning, and check your storage configuration for performance and stability gains. This can be a much more affordable solution in some cases rather than purchasing a new computer. I will also recommend hardware upgrades that are needed to keep your computer performing in top shape.</p>
