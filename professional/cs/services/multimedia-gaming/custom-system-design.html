<h1 id="custom-system-design">Custom System Design</h1>
<p>I design custom computer systems built specifically for your needs. Whether you feel like you are not getting what you expect from a well known manufacturer, or you have set of specifications that you want including in your own personal system I offer specialized skills in:</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Hardware installation</li>
<li>Custom hardware and software tuning</li>
<li>Hardware and software support</li>
<li>Performance tuning</li>
<li>System stability testing and resolutions</li>
</ul>
<p>Why buy a retail computer with a bunch of extra options that you don't need, costing you money that you don't have? Retail computer manufacturers usually install cheap hardware to keep their costs down. In addition, to support third party affiliate's agendas, they install unnecessary software that can slow your computer down and take up valuable resources that could be used for other, more important tasks.</p>
