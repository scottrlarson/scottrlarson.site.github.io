- System stability testing and resolutions


Why buy a retail computer with a bunch of extra options that you don't need, costing you money that you don't have? Retail computer manufacturers usually install cheap hardware to keep their costs down. In addition, to support third party affiliate's agendas, they install unnecessary software that can slow your computer down and take up valuable resources that could be used for other, more important tasks.
